# 🚀 **SynapticFlow** - Lightning Fast AI Companion

## 📋 Project Overview

**SynapticFlow: A High-Freedom AI Agent Platform - Infinitely Expandable with MCP!**

SynapticFlow is a next-generation desktop AI agent platform that combines the lightness of Tauri with the intuitiveness of React. Users can automate all daily tasks by giving AI agents their own unique personalities and abilities.

## 🎯 Key Features and Characteristics

SynapticFlow is a high-freedom AI agent tool that helps users define and manage their own AI agents. In particular, it is designed to support Multi-Agent Orchestration, allowing multiple agents to cooperatively perform complex tasks. These agent and Multi-Agent configurations can be easily shared and extracted, maximizing collaboration and reusability among users.

### ✅ Implemented Features

- **🤖 Role Management System**: Create/edit/delete various AI agent roles.
- **🧠 System Prompt**: Define custom AI personalities for each role.
- **🔗 Real-time MCP Connection**: Run local MCP servers via stdio protocol **[Completed!]**
- **⚡ Tool Calling System**: Call tools from the MCP server in real-time **[Completed!]**
- **💾 IndexedDB Storage**: Store roles/conversations in a browser local database.
- **⚡ Tauri Backend**: High-performance native desktop app framework.
- **🎨 UI Components**: Modern terminal-style interface.
- **⚙️ Centralized Configuration Management**: All settings, including API keys, models, and message window sizes, are managed and permanently stored within the app **[Completed!]**
- **🤝 Agent and Multi-Agent Configuration Sharing/Extraction**: Easily export and import agent and Multi-Agent configurations.

### 🚧 In Progress

- **🔄 AI Integration**: Connect with AI models like OpenAI/Claude.
- **📎 Advanced Features**: File attachments, conversation history, complex tool calls.

## 🛠 Technology Stack

- **Tauri**: High-performance cross-platform desktop app framework (Rust + WebView).
- **React 18**: Modern UI library.
- **TypeScript**: Type safety and developer experience.
- **RMCP**: Rust-based Model Context Protocol client.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework.
- **IndexedDB**: Browser-based NoSQL database.
- **Vite**: Fast development server and build tool.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Prerequisites

- **Rust**: Install from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
- **Node.js**: v18 or higher
- **pnpm**: `npm install -g pnpm`

### 2. Environment Variables (API keys are managed within the app)

This project does not store API keys in `.env` files. Instead, they are entered directly into the settings modal within the application and securely stored in `localStorage`. Therefore, no separate `.env` file setup is required.

## 🔑 Quick Start Guide

### Obtaining AI API Keys and Setting Them in the App

After running the application, open the settings modal by clicking the 'Settings' button in the top right corner. In the 'API Key Settings' tab, you can enter and save API keys for various AI service providers (Groq, OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini).

**1. Groq (Free, Fast Inference)** - Recommended! 🌟

1. Visit [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/keys)
2. Create an account and click "Create API Key"
3. Enter the generated key into the app's settings modal.

**2. OpenAI (GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini)**

1. Visit [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Enter the generated key into the app's settings modal.

**3. Anthropic (Claude-3.5-Sonnet)**

1. Visit [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com/)
2. Generate a new key in the API Keys section.
3. Enter the generated key into the app's settings modal.

**4. Gemini (Google Gemini)**

1. Visit [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey)
2. "Create API key in new project" or generate a key from an existing project.
3. Enter the generated key into the app's settings modal.

> 💡 **Tip**: Groq is fast and powerful enough even on the free tier!

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install Node.js dependencies
pnpm install

# Rust dependencies are installed automatically
```

### 4. Run in Development Mode

```bash
pnpm tauri dev
```

### 5. Production Build

```bash
pnpm tauri build
```

## 📈 Next Steps

2. Full MCP protocol implementation.
3. AI model integration (OpenAI/Claude/local models).
4. Add advanced UI/UX features.
5. Cross-platform testing and deployment.

## 🎨 UI/UX Features

- **Terminal Style**: Developer-friendly dark theme.
- **Responsive Design**: Supports various screen sizes.
- **Modern Interface**: Clean design based on Tailwind CSS.
- **Intuitive Operation**: Drag-and-drop, modal dialogs, etc.

## 🧪 Current Status
